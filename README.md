## Stakeholders

We interviewed a friend to understand their needs for an anonymous social media app. Here are the goals and frustrations we identified:

### Key Goals/Needs Identified:

- **Express freely and anonymously**: Allowing honest opinions without fear of personal backlash.  
- **Campus-specific filtering**: Easily access content that is directly relevant to the user’s college or courses.  
- **Moderation and safe community**: Implement guidelines and reporting mechanisms to keep discussions constructive and safe.  
- **Interactive engagement**: Enable features like polls, event updates, and community group discussions to foster involvement.  

### Key Problems/Frustrations Identified:

- **Toxicity and trolling**: Anonymity can lead to negative behavior that overwhelms the constructive content.  
- **Lack of focus**: General anonymous apps often mix unrelated content, making it hard to find campus-related discussions.  
- **Navigation difficulties**: Overwhelming noise and poor filtering result in a frustrating user experience.  
- **Security concerns**: The possibility of abuse of anonymity can make users feel unsafe or hesitant to participate.  

## Product Vision Statement

> “Empower college students to share genuine insights and campus-specific experiences on an anonymous, secure, and interactive social platform that fosters community engagement, informed discussions, and safe expression.”
